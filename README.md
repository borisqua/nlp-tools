# Natural language processing tools

A collection of NLP instruments, written in Java.

There are a bunch of wonderful NLP java frameworks:
- Apache OpenNLP
- Apache UIMA
- GATE
- MALLET
- ReVerb
- CogComp-NLP
- LingPipe
- MALLET
- NLP4J
- Stanford CoreNLP
- Lucene

However, I'm assembling mine. I make it just for fun, like a demo app. And to understand the matter more deeply.
