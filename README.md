# Natural language processing tools
I want to collect here a set of various NLP tools. 
For now, I have the first one: [the automated readability index](#automated-readability-index).

## Automated readability index
This is a demo project with the implementation of common methods for readability measurement.

See [Automated Readability Index in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_readability_index) for details.

### Build and run

Required JDK 14 installed.

If JDK is ready, run the command line from the root application directory:
```bash
sudo chmod +x start_app.sh
./start_app.sh file.txt
```
or in Windows command console
```cmd
start_app.cmd file.txt
```
here *file.txt* is the name of the file with a text being analyzed for readability.
